# Animal Image Classifier

Project made for a practice task in Kaggle.

---

## Project Overview

**Animal-Image-Classifier** is a simple machine learning project designed to classify images of animals using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The main goal is to explore image classification workflows and gain hands-on experience with model training on real-world datasets.

---

## Features

- Classify animal images into predefined categories
- Uses Jupyter Notebook for code development and experiment tracking
- Processes image datasets and prepares data for training and validation
- Demonstrates the basics of deep learning for image classification

## How To Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries: See notebook for details

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sharmaanikhil/Animal-Image-Classifier.git
    cd Animal-Image-Classifier
    ```

2. Install dependencies (in a new Python environment):
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    # Or install packages as listed/imported in the notebook
    ```

3. Open the notebook:
    ```
    jupyter notebook Animal\ Classification.ipynb
    ```
4. Follow the notebook for data loading, model training, and testing.

## Dataset

This project uses animal image datasets (such as those available on Kaggle) containing multiple classes of animals for the classification task.

---

## Future Improvements

- Expand to more animal categories
- Experiment with various model architectures (CNNs, transfer learning)
- Visualize misclassifications and model performance
- Deploy as a web app for live classification
- Add custom dataset support
